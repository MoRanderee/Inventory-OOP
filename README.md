# Nike Warehousing

This was a capstone project where I developed a program, using my skills in Object Orientated Programming (OOP), that allows a Nike store manager to perform stock-taking in a quick and efficient way.

Nike warehouses store the following information for each stock-taking list:
Country, Code, Product, Cost, Quantity, Value.

In addition, the program allows other store managers (in other regions) to do the following:
● Search products by code.
● Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
● Determine the product with the highest quantity.
● Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by
multiplying the cost by the quantity for each item entered into the system.
